## Features

Presents color schemes, fonts, and text sizes that will be followed. Clients and customers may reference this template to select designs that they like.

## Project Status

Website Design System will continue to be updated as preferences change and as I develop my full stack web development skills. Further functionalities will be added in the future.

## Room for Improvement

- Make the website more responsive to see from various devices
- Have an option for users to select and filter designs based on what they are looking for.
